## Introduction

Vision-language-action (VLA) models are essential in bridging the gap between visual data and natural language understanding. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Vlarl aims to provide a robust framework that allows for the development and experimentation of VLA models in various applications, such as robotics, automated customer service, and interactive AI systems.

## Features

- **Single-file Implementation**: Easy to use and integrate into existing projects.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Built-in support for various RL algorithms.
- **Modular Design**: Flexibility to adapt and extend for specific use cases.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions to help you get started quickly.

## Getting Started

To get started with Vlarl, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Niman1986/vlarl/releases). 
   - You need to download the file and execute it to start using Vlarl.

2. **Set up your environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed. Vlarl is compatible with Python 3.7 and above.
   - Install the necessary dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Vlarl script**:
   - After downloading, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run:

   ```bash
   python vlarl.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you have Vlarl set up, you can start experimenting with various configurations. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

```python
from vlarl import VLA

# Initialize the VLA model
model = VLA()

# Train the model
model.train(episodes=1000)

# Evaluate the model
results = model.evaluate()
print(results)
```

### Configuration Options

Vlarl allows you to customize various parameters to fit your specific needs:

- **Learning Rate**: Adjust the learning rate for the reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Episodes**: Set the number of training episodes.
- **Model Architecture**: Choose from different neural network architectures.
