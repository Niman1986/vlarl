## 🌟 Highlights

- 🎯 **General Manipulation**: Improving OpenVLA-7B with outcome-based multi-task reinforcement learing.

- ⚡️ **Cutting-edge Architecture**: Built with Ray+vLLM+LoRA+FSDP, our codebase delivers both scalability and flexibility.

- 📝 **Clean Implementation**: Following [cleanrl](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl)'s philosophy, we provide a single-file implementation for easy reading and modification.

- 🚧 **Active Development**: Work in Progress, let's build it together.

## 📝 TODO
- [ ] Support SERL-style Real-world RL
- [ ] Support More Environments (e.g., Roboverse)
- [ ] Support More VLAs (e.g., MiniVLA)

## 🛠️ Installation

See [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions. 

See [ERROR_CATCH.md](docs/ERROR_CATCH.md) for error catching.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Before launching distributed training, please edit the script with the appropriate dataset and model paths first.

### 📈 Training

```bash
# bash scripts/train_rl_vllm_ray_fsdp.sh <gpus> <task_ids>
# e.g., 
bash scripts/train_rl_vllm_ray_fsdp.sh 0,1 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```

### 🧪 Evaluation

```bash
# parallel evaluation with vectorized environment
bash scripts/eval_vllm_ray.sh 0,1
```
